## Recommendation

### For You

**Recommended path:** Build Sentinel Router as integrated product

**Reasoning:**
1. ✅ All 3 components are validated independently
2. ✅ Integration creates unique competitive advantage
3. ✅ Market timing is right (RAG exploding, compliance critical)
4. ✅ Technical risk is low (proven components)
5. ✅ Financial upside is significant (10-20x ARR exit)

**Alternative:** If resources are constrained, start with Router_llm + Position Optimizer (simpler integration), add Valanyx steering later

## FAQ

### Q: Can this work with my existing RAG system?

**A:** Yes! Sentinel Router can integrate as:
- Standalone (full replacement)
- Middleware (add position optimization to existing RAG)
- SDK (library you call from your code)

### Q: Do I need all 3 components?

**A:** No. You can use:
- Router_llm alone (intent routing)
- Router_llm + Position Optimizer (most ROI for least complexity)
- All 3 (maximum accuracy + compliance)

### Q: What if position effects don't work for my data?

**A:** Position optimization can be toggled per query. We recommend A/B testing to validate. If it doesn't help, disable it (no harm).

### Q: How much does it cost to run?

**A:** With Ollama local models:
- Compute: ~$10/month (cloud instance)
- Storage: ~$5/month (embeddings)
- **Total: ~$15/month for 10K queries**

Compare to: GPT-4 = $1,000/month for same load

### Q: Is this production-ready?

**A:** Components are production-ready individually. Integration needs 12 weeks of work to reach production quality.

### Q: What's the patent situation?

**A:** Position-aware RAG is novel and potentially patentable. Recommend filing provisional patent before public launch.
